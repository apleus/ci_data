0|B0B5W1YJN1|RG8E2MAGWZ6GD|Irene Aguilar|5|Enjoying my Keurig|United States|20230221|Color: GrayStyle: K-Supreme|True|Efficient, quiet and makes your coffee quickly. You can make up to a 12oz cup of coffee. The water container on the side with handle is the reason I purchased this Keurig. I was searching for a new Keurig and this one met all my needs!
1|B0B5W1YJN1|RS7J1KDLEUTO5|Sean Patrick Alexander|2|Brews Rich Smooth Coffee, many imperfections !|United States|20230221|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme|True|"The coffee this machine brews makes it a 5 Star Machine! However, it has some significant imperfections that reduce its value. I purchased a Keurig after many years of failures with lesser-known brands.

Pros:
The Multistream Technology
Removable water pitcher
Sleek design
66oz Water Pitcher

Cons:
The water pitcher is unstable in its stand, even completely filled.
The Descaling process is too complicated.
The use of a Keurig My K-Cup is confusing and impractical. The odds of breaking the Pod Holder Assembly is high.

Not recommended around Cats or children."
2|B0B5W1YJN1|RJUZLCVEVB0TC|Richard F.|4|Pretty good quick coffee.|United States|20230221|Color: GrayStyle: K-Supreme|True|This is the second of this model I have owned. First one lasted about 3 years. Certainly not as good as a drip coffee but not too bad and no waste. I can get pods for between 50 and 60 cents a cup. There are many brands to choose from.
3|B0B5W1YJN1|R28U36L1FFLPVM|Mastiff Enthusiast|5|Good improvement|United States|20230221|Color: GrayStyle: K-Supreme|True|We had a 10 year old keurig, and of had started not quite producing the amount of coffee it said. (10 oz for the 12oz setting) . Switched to this one. Prettier, slimmer, gives to the full 12oz, and tastes better. Success.

k. Cups and clean water."
5|B0B5W1YJN1|RMUUP8R51IXWU|Kindle Customer|3|Hi tech, and easy to use!|United States|20230220|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme SMART|True|I like the way you can set it up so easily and quickly and control. The temperature .
6|B0B5W1YJN1|R2QKXHJOGISG4Q|Amazon Customer|2|Disappointing ðŸ‘Ž|United States|20230220|Color: GrayStyle: K-Supreme|True|It seems like I keep getting a cup of coffee grinds I have tried different pods once in a while I get a good cup thatâ€™s made right but it seems to be popping open my pods Very disappointing

8|B0B5W1YJN1|R3OKD5HKBZTNJ2|Vance Bell|5|Better than my previous model|United States|20230220|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme SMART|True|Like the pitcher with a handle much easier to use than my previous model machine. Also like settling favorites for may various coffees.
9|B0B5W1YJN1|R2UYI6V7C7UD1R|Beth E. Lorentz|1|Just stopped working|United States|20230220|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme|True|This multi stream single serve Keurig is less than one year old, used daily for four cups of coffee only and it just stopped working! Very frustrating! Junk!
10|B0B5W1YJN1|R24GRKCLXZ75VH|Stevo|3|It works|United States|20230219|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme|True|Stopped working after 2 weeks
11|B0B5W1YJN1|RMPV4D259MIDH|detruck|1|Absolutely trash X 3|United States|20230219|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme|False|These are bad, last 1 to 3 months. Stupid me, bought 3 of them in a year and each one lasted for about 3 months. Getting a replacement they want a receipt which my wife says she saves them all but I buy these. Save a receipt for something costing $130? I donâ€™t. But if you purchase this one, save yours because I would bet you that it will not last but maybe 3 months. It looks nice, but yours will break pretty quickly. Do not be fooled by the ratings, the ratings are wrong.
12|B0B5W1YJN1|R2V98LY97LBLTJ|Rkstrtchr|5|WOW- THis is perfect|United States|20230219|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme|True|I did a lot of research before buying a Keurig. I have always liked my pot of coffee but with just two of us drinking about 3 cups a day I wanted to find something more efficient. As I researched I found that the newer multi stream technology led to richer tasting coffee. I also order the refillable K-Cup with the multi-stream pod and use the K-cup paper filters to save on waste and on coffee expense. I ordered the scoop which perfectly measure the portions and I can easily prepare that before work or have it ready the night before. The quality of the coffee even with a less expensive store brand is SO good with the multi-stream technology. I am glad I choose one with a reservoir. I thought originally the single serve would be fine, but it is nice to have the very ample water supply ready any time. I hope to try it with decaf soon too and see how that tastees. This was really the best coffee maker purchase I have made. I know I am saving money on coffee and have a good fresh cup everytime I make a cup. I especially appreciate the strong feature on this model as I like a good strong cup. Highly recommended!
13|B0B5W1YJN1|R1UCUXUVGZYK4T|Southern Illinois rock hunter|4|Quick and reliable Brew|United States|20230218|Color: WhiteStyle: K-Supreme SMART|True|I have used it now for a few months. The Bluetooth option works fine. Although I never use it. Overall I am pleased with the brew. I wouldnâ€™t recommend spending the xtra money for the Bluetooth option.
14|B0B5W1YJN1|R2ZVS1383LRIJ0|Harry|1|Bad model times 2 attempts|United States|20230218|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme|False|I bought 2 of these machines from Sam's 1 st and Christmas and it worked well for almost 1 month and Turned off and would not work again!!!! I unplugged , Checked my ground fault plugs, all working properly. I returned to Sam's and got the exact same Kerig machine again. Worked perfect for a month , shut off again same way! I will return but not get the same product! There is a problem with the batch or something . Do not want to deal with it again. I liked the the water reservoir had a handle on it like a pitcher for easy fill. But there is a major issue this this model!

16|B0B5W1YJN1|R3A6K9RHNESH99|Linda C. Nianouris|5|Great Keurig|United States|20230218|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme SMART|True|Makes the best coffee. I have had several Keurigs but this is best!
17|B0B5W1YJN1|RHV6ROIK9CMXL|Fred in AZ|3|Not same flexibility as the classic|United States|20230217|Color: BlackStyle: K-Supreme|True|Overall, this is a great single cup coffee maker, e.g. a variety of cup sizes. Two drawbacks: 1. You must use K cups made with plastic, you cannot use coffee pods from Trader Joes as you can in the classic - if you do it makes a big mess. 2. The fill and brew from your coffee is overly complicated again compared to the simplicity of the classic.
18|B0B5W1YJN1|R1GI2UQG7ULCV7|dmb|1|Not Worth It...|United States|20230217|Color: GrayStyle: K-Supreme|True|I purchased this product in July of 21. By Sept. 21 I had to have it replaced as it stopped working. Now, four-months out of warranty and it breaks again. I will not replace with another Keurig
19|B0B5W1YJN1|RR4RYQP7AELCS|I. TOMPKINS|1|The Fastest Flop of a CoffeePot|United States|20230217|Color: WhiteStyle: K-Supreme|True|"Just after 3 months, this coffeepot became practically useless. The cups got smaller and smaller, even after going through the LENGTHY cleaning process to descale it using the Kurig de-scaling solution kit. We could NOT get the ""descale"" light to go off, despite trying every trick and button. I COMPLAINED TO KURIG WEEKS AGO AND HAVE YET TO HEAR BACK. Avoid this machine."
